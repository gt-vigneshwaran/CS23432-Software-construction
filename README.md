Problem statement : Real Estate Portal

● Property Listing and Search:
        o Users can post properties for sale with details
          like price, location, and contact information.
          
        o Property search functionality should allow
          users to filter properties based on area, BHK,
          location, amenities, and other criteria.

● Review System:
        o Users can post reviews of their dealing
          experiences with other users after a transaction.

        o Reviews help in verifying a seller's profile and
          past deal experiences, enabling users to make
          informed decisions before dealing with
          someone.

● Builder Login and Project Posting:
      o Builders should have a login to post new
        projects for users looking to buy new flats or
        offices.

      o The system should allow builders to showcase
        their projects and attract potential buyers.

Additionally , the advanced realiable real estate portal must
also present an option to give the user predictions of house
prices based on the various filters in the website , using
machine learning models and kaggle datasets of real world
data.

**Project implementation**

**ALL LISTED PROPERTY ARE FAKE AND ARE FOR SHOW ONLY**

The project , advanced reliable real estate portal , makes use of the following functional 
modules :

        It also allows the user to search for properties.

**2. Property Listing with Filters**

        The next feature implemented is the property listing , which is dependent on the various 
        filters implemented to allow the user to find a property of their choice.

**3. Property Detail Page**

        The property detail page allows the user to see the general available property that is 
        widely looked for.

**4. User Authentication**

        This page allows a user to login with their credentials and allows them to freely search 
        for property that is listed on the website.

**5. Builder Authentication with Project Posting**

        This separate authentication system for a builder or seller, exists to authenticate each 
        property listed on the website and aims to allow builders or sellers to separately sell 
        or showcase property.

**6. Review System for User experiences**

        The review system exists to extract user feedback on the website on operate in the future 
        based off of the same.
